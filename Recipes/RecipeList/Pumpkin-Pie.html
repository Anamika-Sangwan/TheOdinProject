    <h3>Do You Need to Blind Bake the Pie Crust?</h3>
    <p>
        Blind baking refers to baking pie crust, either partially or completely, without filling it. 
        Why would you do this? Pie with a custard-based filling, such as pumpkin, generally requires little oven 
        time, which means you may want to give your crust a bit of a head start to ensure you don't end up with a 
        raw, soggy bottom.
