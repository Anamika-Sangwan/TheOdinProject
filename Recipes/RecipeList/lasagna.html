    <h3>How to Reheat Lasagna</h3>
    <p>
        You can use the microwave to reheat lasagna if you're in a pinch or short on time, but be aware that it will change the texture of 
        the noodles. The best way to reheat lasagna is in the oven. Simply cover the leftovers with foil and bake at 350 degrees F for about
         half an hour, or until it's heated through and the sauce is bubbly.
