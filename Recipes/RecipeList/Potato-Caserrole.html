    <h3>How to Make Sweet Potato Casserole</h3>
    <p>
        You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's a brief overview of what you can expect 
        when you make this top-rated sweet potato casserole:
        <ol>
            <li>Cook and mash the sweet potatoes.</li>
            <li>Mix the casserole ingredients and transfer to a baking dish.</li>
            <li>Make the topping and sprinkle it over the sweet potato mixture.</li>
            <li>Bake until the topping is lightly browned.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <h3>Can You Make Sweet Potato Casserole Ahead of Time?</h3>
    <p>
        Yes, you can prepare this sweet potato casserole one to two days in advance. 
        It's a great way to get a head start on Thanksgiving! To make ahead, simply prepare the filling 
        and topping separately — but don't bake anything yet. Tightly cover the baking dish and place the topping 
        in an airtight container. Store them both in the refrigerator until you're ready to cook.
    </p>
    <p>
        On the big day, sprinkle the topping onto the filling and bake according to the directions 
        (you may have to add a few minutes to the baking time to account for the cold temperature).
