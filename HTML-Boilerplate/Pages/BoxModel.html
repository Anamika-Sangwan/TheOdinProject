<!-- Margin is collapsable, so if box one has a margin of 50 and box two has 
 a margin of 50x, then the space between them is not going to be 100px, its going 
 to be 50px only. Now, if the margin of box 2 was changed from 50px to 60px, the space between 
 box one and box two will be 60px only i.e margin of box two will increase by 10px -->

 <!-- Border box sets the height and width to be what we want the box to be inclusive of the 
  padding and border, otherwise the height and width are exclusive of the padding and the 
  border. Note:- margin is not considered when counting the  box height and width-->
