        <!-- The href is the destination link and the target opens it in a new page, if it is not present then by default, 
         it is marked as _self and it opens in the same webpage.
         The noopener in the ref tag ensure that the new page cannot interact with the orignal page i.e its JS cannot change the original page
         the noreferrer provides security and privacy, this ensures the page doesn't know where the user came from, it does the job of noopener too.-->
